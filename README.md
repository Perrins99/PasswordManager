This is a password manager that uses a local SQL database to store passwords; this database can be accessed by a Master Password and stores the service (like google.com, facebook.com and so on), the username and the password. It's important to install a MySQL local server in order to run this program correctly (you can download what you need here: https://www.mysql.com/it/downloads/) and also to change the informations passed as function parameters in line 180.

Future changes:
  - Show a specific password only when asked (do not show all passwords contemporarly, show a series of "-" and make the user select the password he/she wants to be shown
  - Add a GUI

Any suggestion is well accepted. Thank You!
